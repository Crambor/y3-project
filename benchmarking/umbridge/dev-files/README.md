# dev files


Files in here are old remnants from a failed attempt at creating my own custom load balancing solution.

/caddy-middleware-stuff is an attempt creating a reverse proxy middleware so that I could bundle the entire application into a single portable binary, utilising the Caddy software for this purpose.

/custom-proxy-implementation was an even earlier attempt at doing this solely from scratch.


Anything in this folder did not work and were subsequently abandoned, but I have left these in here for future reference as I wish to come back to this in the future.
